\section{Problem statement}
Welcome to this \LaTeX{} Thesis Template, a beautiful and easy to use template for writing a thesis using the \LaTeX{} typesetting system.

If you are writing a thesis (or will be in the future) and its subject is technical or mathematical (though it doesn't have to be), then creating it in \LaTeX{} is highly recommended as a way to make sure you can just get down to the essential writing without having to worry over formatting or wasting time arguing with your word processor.

\LaTeX{} is easily able to professionally typeset documents that run to hundreds or thousands of pages long. With simple mark-up commands, it automatically sets out the table of contents, margins, page headers and footers and keeps the formatting consistent and beautiful. One of its main strengths is the way it can easily typeset mathematics, even \emph{heavy} mathematics. Even if those equations are the most horribly twisted and most difficult mathematical problems that can only be solved on a super-computer, you can at least count on \LaTeX{} to make them look stunning.

\section{Related work}

\LaTeX{} is not a WYSIWYG (What You See is What You Get) program, unlike word processors such as Microsoft Word or Apple's Pages. Instead, a document written for \LaTeX{} is actually a simple, plain text file that contains \emph{no formatting}. You tell \LaTeX{} how you want the formatting in the finished document by writing in simple commands amongst the text, for example, if I want to use \textit{italic text for emphasis}, I write the `$\backslash$\texttt{textit}\{\}' command and put the text I want in italics in between the curly braces. This means that \LaTeX{} is a ``mark-up'' language, very much like HTML.

\subsection{Problems addressed by previous research}

If you are new to \LaTeX{}, there is a very good eBook -- freely available online as a PDF file -- called, ``The Not So Short Introduction to \LaTeX{}''. The book's title is typically shortened to just ``lshort''. You can download the latest version (as it is occasionally updated) from here:\\
\href{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf}{\texttt{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf}}

It is also available in several other languages. Find yours from the list on this page:\\
\href{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/}{\texttt{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/}}

It is recommended to take a little time out to learn how to use \LaTeX{} by creating several, small `test' documents. Making the effort now means you're not stuck learning the system when what you \emph{really} need to be doing is writing your thesis.

\subsection{Methods used in previous research}

If you are writing a technical or mathematical thesis, then you may want to read the document by the AMS (American Mathematical Society) called, ``A Short Math Guide for \LaTeX{}''. It can be found online here:\\
\href{http://www.ams.org/tex/amslatex.html}{\texttt{http://www.ams.org/tex/amslatex.html}}\\
under the ``Additional Documentation'' section towards the bottom of the page.

\subsection{Critics on previous research}
There are a multitude of mathematical symbols available for \LaTeX{} and it would take a great effort to learn the commands for them all. The most common ones you are likely to use are shown on this page:\\
\href{http://www.sunilpatel.co.uk/latexsymbols.html}{\texttt{http://www.sunilpatel.co.uk/latexsymbols.html}}

You can use this page as a reference or crib sheet, the symbols are rendered as large, high quality images so you can quickly find the \LaTeX{} command for the symbol you need.

\subsection{\LaTeX{} on a Mac}
 
The \LaTeX{} package is available for many systems including Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. The package for OS X is called MacTeX and it contains all the applications you need -- bundled together and pre-customised -- for a fully working \LaTeX{} environment and workflow.
 
MacTeX includes a dedicated \LaTeX{} IDE (Integrated Development Environment) called ``TeXShop'' for writing your `\texttt{.tex}' files and ``BibDesk'': a program to manage your references and create your bibliography section just as easily as managing songs and creating playlists in iTunes.
